# CoffeeProject
This is a project I created while self-teaching HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The project is a simple website with responsive design that includes a landing page and a sign-up page.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply download or clone the project files and open the main.html file in your web browser.

## Features:
- Landing page
- Sign up page
